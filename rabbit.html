      Rabbits are small mammals and herbivores, the most popular among them being Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus.
      Their personalities are usually shy and curious, making them a popular pet choice. However, rabbits prefer
      to live in groups and create group nests for their habitat. One of rabbits' favorite food are grass hays.
