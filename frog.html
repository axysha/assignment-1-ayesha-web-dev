      Frogs are amphibians that have eyes which poke out, no tails, and strong feet. 
      Their feet are very useful for them as frogs use them for swimming and jumping around. 
      Although most of them live in/around water, some of them also stay on land and in trees. 
      A frog's typical diet is other insects like worms, rodents, and even other frogs
